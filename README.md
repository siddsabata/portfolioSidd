# Portfolio 
This is a repository containing projects I have completed with various online courses, and 
by myself. All projects are written in Python Jupyter Notebooks, unless stated otherwise. 

## Contents 
- ### Bioinformatics 
    - [Gene Finder](https://github.com/siddsabata/portfolio/blob/master/Gene%20Finder/gene_finder.ipynb): A program to 
convert GenBank data into easy-to-read gene tables. 
    - [gRNA Generator](https://github.com/siddsabata/portfolio/blob/master/gRNA%20Generator/gRNA_generator.ipynb): A high throughput script to generate CRISPR Cas9 guide RNA molecules. 
- ### Data Visualization
    - [Climate Data Visualization](https://github.com/siddsabata/portfolio/blob/master/Climate%20Data%20Visualization/main.ipynb): Coursera's Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python final assignment that describes climate trends in Ann Arbor, MI
- ### Dynamical System Modeling
    - [True Lorenz System Approximation](https://github.com/siddsabata/portfolio/blob/master/True%20Lorenz%20System%20Approximation/lorenz_basis.ipynb): A notebook showcasing the modeling of a non-linear dynamical system, and the regression of synthetically generated data.
- ### Machine Learning
    - [Predicting protein type from X-ray diffraction data](https://siddsabata.github.io/): A machine learning project from my undergraduate Introduction to Machine Learning class in R utilizing tidyverse and tidymodels. Note: Source code is provided in this repository, but the link will direct to a website hosting the final report.
- ### Other
    - [DiffCoEx](https://github.com/siddsabata/DiffCoEx): A class project which uses Go to speed up data preprocessing and significance testing with parallelization.
